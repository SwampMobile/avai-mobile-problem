#Avai Mobile Interview Problem

##The Problem:

Your task is to create an Android application that displays the search results from the DuckDuckGo search engine.  The app should allow user entry via a text field with an “Submit” button.  When pressing Submit, the app should query the DuckDuckGo API for results.  It should present a second Activity that displays the following:

 * “Definition" from the query results
 * A list of “text” from the “related topics” list 

While the above functionality is the only set of requirements, feel free to expand on this design and functionality as desired. 
 
The project should have a target API of 19 and a minimum API of 14. It should be able to be opened, compiled, and run in either Eclipse or Android Studio.  It should run on a connected Android device.
 
On completion, send us a zipped up project folder and an APK.
